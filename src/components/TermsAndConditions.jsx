           We will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) incase of fraud. It is your responsibility to provide us with an email address which is not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the purchase. If you fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in nature and be denied.</SectionText>

          Our transfers team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we can not make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.  </SectionText>
       <SectionText>
        The free transfer services are available for 30 days from your signup date. Transfers outside of the 30 day free period will incur a charge; please contact a member of the support department with specific details to receive a price quote.

           You the registrant agrees to provide, maintain and update, current, complete and accurate information of the Whois Record and all the data elements about the domain name during the term of the domain name/order/service. You the registrant agrees that provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, and/or Registrant’s failure to promptly update information, or non-receipt of a response for over five (5) calendar days to inquiries sent to the email address of the Registrant or any other contact listed for the domain name concerning the accuracy of contact information associated with the domain name shall be constituted as a breach of this Agreement and a basis for freezing, suspending, or deleting that domain name/service. </SectionText>

          <SectionTitle>4.) Payment Information</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
           You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from Elexdonhost.com.ng, in advance of the time period during which such services are provided. You agree that until and unless you notify Elexdonhost.com.ng of your desire to cancel any or all services received, those services will be billed on a recurring basis.
<br/><br/>
Cancellations must be done in writing via the cancellation form provided in your client area on our website. To cancel a VPS/Dedicated server service, the client must submit a cancellation request 10 days before the invoice due date, else the cancellation request will be void and the client will be billed for the next subscription month. Once we receive your cancellation and have confirmed all necessary information with you via e-mail, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject for your reference, and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic “Your request has been received…” email with a tracking number. An employee will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed.
<br/><br/>
As a client of Elexdonhost.com.ng, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. Any invoice that is overdue and not paid will result in a late fee and/or an account suspension until account balance has been paid in full.
<br/><br/>
Invoices that have been paid more than once with multiple InterSwitch Subscriptions can only be added as credit towards the account and cannot be refunded via InterSwitch. If you require assistance with this provision, please contactsupport@elexdonhost.com.ng 
<br/><br/>
It is the clients responsibility to confirm that the domain name/hosting/services paid for during activation or renewal is successful by checking that your CPanel area is loading without any issues or checking your domains whois record to confirm domain registration or renewal within 24hrs after a payment confirmation or a service renewal confirmation, especially when using automated online payment options like Interswitch or Bank Transfers, to avoid loss of data from the termination of the hosting package/service or loss of the domain name due to expiration.
<br/><br/>
Elexdongost.com.ng reserves the right to change the yearly payment amount and any other charges at anytime.  </SectionText>

          <SectionTitle>5.) Backups and Data Loss</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
           Your use of the service is at your sole risk. Elexdonhost.com.ng is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on Elexdonhost.com.ng servers. You may refer to our backup policy for more information about backups.
<br/><br/>
It is your sole responsibility as a customer to make backups of the information you store on our servers on a regular basis and save them in a separate location from your account. Using a shared account as a backup/storage device is not permitted. We recommend that you make use of reliable and offsite third-party backup services such as but not limited to CodeGuard, JetPack, etc to make backup copies of your website.
<br/><br/>

We strongly recommend that you maintain periodic backups of your website’s information and store them in a secure location so that you have multiple options for recovering your data in the event of any loss. Our control panel also provides tools that allow you to take data, download and restore backups, etc.</SectionText>

          <SectionTitle>6.) Cancellations and Refunds</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
           Elexdonhost.com.ng reserves the right to cancel the account at any time with or without notice.
<br/><br/>
Any abuse of our staff in any medium or format will result in the suspension or termination of your services.
<br/><br/>
Cancellations must be done in writing via the cancellation form provided in your client area on our website. To cancel a VPS/Dedicated server service, the client must submit a cancellation request 10 days before the invoice due date, else the cancellation request will be void and the client will be billed for the next subscription month. Once we receive your cancellation and have confirmed all necessary information with you via e-mail, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject for your reference, and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic “Your request has been received…” email with a tracking number. An employee will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed.
<br/><br/>
None payment of due invoices when due would lead to service termination after 30 days for shared hosting. VPS/Dedicated servers hosting will be terminated 7 days after the due date and the clients account would be suspended until the overdue recurring subscription invoice is paid as server charges have already been made on such services to the data centers.
<br/><br/>
<strong>The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:
</strong><br/>
* Bank Wire Transfers<br/>
* InterSwitch Debit Cards<br/>
* Cheque’s
<br/><br/>
There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.
<br/><br/>
Violations of the Terms of Service will waive the refund policy (if any). </SectionText>

           User may not:<br/>
a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.<br/>
b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.<br/>
c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.<br/>
d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.<br/>
e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.<br/>
f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities<br/>
g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc<br/>
h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes<br/>

When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include(“http://yourdomain.com/include.php”) use include(“include.php”)

          <SectionTitle>7b.) INODES</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
          The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid overusage. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.
<br/><br/>
Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension.
The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose “Mail”, then “Default Address”, “Set Default Address”, and then type in: :fail: No such user here</SectionText>

          <SectionText>
         You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</SectionText>

          <SectionTitle>9b.) Uptime Guarantee</SectionTitle>
          <SectionText>
       If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of Qservers.net dependant upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor’s network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact support@elexdonhost.com.ng with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.

Qservers.net reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please contact support@elexdonhost.com.ng if you wish to obtain a secondary hard drive.
